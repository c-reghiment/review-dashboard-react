"76e15f0cdd8ed60483b0603212b4fb2f","reducing-new-mom-stress-by-psychologist-sergiu-toma",,4,"I found in this journey very important ideas of motherhood, the most important idea that resonates with my inner mood is “Maintaining an intense pace for the next few years is not sustainable”.  I realized that sometimes ask too much from myself, but giving birth to a child and caring of him is already an important and valuable role. And I should appreciate myself more often for this and take another extra tasks more easily. 
 I also realized that I need recognition and validation from my loved ones and will tell my husband about this, because a few words help me maintain a balanced mood. 
It was a good journey of reflexion on own thoughts. Wish good luck to creators of this this application in developing useful journeys for everyone !     (4)Olga T.a year ago","2024-11-10",,"https://selftalk.space/journey/reducing-new-mom-stress-by-psychologist-sergiu-toma"

I’ve realized that, for me, 'being enough' is a temporary state of mind that occurs when my present self is not aligned with the self I aspire to be.
Acknowledging this helps me focus on narrowing the gap between who I am and who I want to become by setting a clear direction and action plan.
These steps help reduce anxiety and increase my self-confidence.     (5)Mihaela T.9 months ago","2025-02-10",,"https://selftalk.space/journey/feeling-enough"

The biggest learning for me has been the importance of understanding what truly matters to me—my values—and how they can guide my actions. Recognizing that protecting my well-being, self-worth, and self-respect is not just a necessity, but also a reflection of my values, has shifted my mindset. I’ve learned that boundaries aren’t about shutting others out but about honoring myself and the things that help me thrive.
This journey has given me clarity on how to respond when my boundaries are tested, and it’s empowering to know that I have the ability to act in alignment with what I value, without guilt or fear. I now understand that setting boundaries is an act of self-respect and is essential for maintaining a healthy, balanced life.

It’s not about suppressing emotions but embracing them as part of my human experience. When I choose to “play” with my sadness, I give myself permission to explore it with curiosity rather than fear.

This has been a deeply transformative journey, one that has given me tools to navigate the challenges of life with more ease, while embracing the positive emotions that come from the things I love.
